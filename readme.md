Ravi Gupta is storyteller. He likes to tell stories visually. Either, in the form of an illustration, sequential art, animated film or simply through how a character looks and behaves.
Ravi completed his Graduate Diploma in Animation and Film Design from MIT Institute of Design, Pune. He also holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree with major in English.

As a visual storyteller, he has taken on the roles of a storyboard artist, character designer, motion graphic designer, comic book artist and an art director.

He is currently working on illustrations for the second book of the 'Secret School Mysteries' series written by Ashok Banker and published by Scholastic India. First book from the series titled 'Secret School Mysteries: The Invisible Spy' is available for purchase online.

Wacom products are his tool of choice for Digital Artwork. He owns a 'One by Wacom (CTL-671)' and 'Intuos 4 (PTK-840)'. He currently works with his Wacom tablets on Linux OS (Linux Mint 19.04) and finds that wacom tablets work great out-of-box with Linux.
